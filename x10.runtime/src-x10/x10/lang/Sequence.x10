/**
 * A Sequence represents a fixed-size ordered collection of entities of type T
 * that can be accessed randomly and iterated over using an enhanced-for loop,
 * i.e. for (t:T in S) ...
 * 
 * <p> Sequence provides no operations to update the objects in the underlying collection. This
 * does not mean that the entities in the collection cannot be replaced by others -- just that if that
 * happens, it happens through some other (non-Sequence) reference to underlying implementation objects. 
 * It is up to the implementer of the class or interface implementing Sequence to provide any additional 
 * guarantees.
 * 
 * <p> Code in 2.0.6 and earlier that uses ValRail[T] could be rewritten to use a Sequence over an underlying
 * 1-d array.
