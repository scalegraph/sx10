/**
 * <p> A runtime representation of the topology of Places
 * in a running X10 computation.  A PlaceTopology 
 * captures relationships between the set of live Places.  
 * Depending on the characteristics of the system on which the computation
 * is running, these relationships may include information
 * about the CUDA Places (GPUs) that are attached to a CPU Place
 * or more generally about network topology. </p>
 *
 * <p> A PlaceTopology contains 'primary' Places, which can execute
 * any X10 operation and have full connectivity to all other 
 * primary Places and 'child' Places, which only have connectivity
 * to their 'parent' Place and possibly to their children. A child Place
 * may not be capable of executing all X10 operations; in particular it
 * may be a GPU and only capable of executing the subset of the X10
 * language that can be compiled to CUDA.</p>
