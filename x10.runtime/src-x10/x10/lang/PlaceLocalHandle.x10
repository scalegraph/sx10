/**
 * The primary operation on a PlaceLocalHandle is to use it to access an object
 * on the current place.  If the current place is not part of the PlaceGroup
 * over which the PlaceLocalHandle is defined, a BadPlaceException will be thrown.</p>
 *
 * A key concept for correct usage of PlaceLocalHandles is that in different places,
 * the Handle may be mapped to distinct objects.  For example (assuming >1 Place):
 * <pre>
 *   val plh:PlaceLocalHandle[T] = ....;
 *   val obj:T = plh();
 *   at (here.next()) Console.out.println(plh() == obj);
 * </pre>
 * may print either true or false depending on how the application is
 * using the particular PlaceLocalHandle (mapping the same object at
 * multiple places or mapping distinct object at each place).</p>
