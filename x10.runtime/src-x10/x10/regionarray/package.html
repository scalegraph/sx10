<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides an implementation of single place and distributed arrays and
supporting abstractions such as regions, points, and distributions.</p>

<h3>Points, Regions, and Arrays</h3>

A Point represents a point in a rank-dimensional space. 

The coordinates of a point <code>p</code>


A Region(rank) represents a set of points of class Point(rank). The
Region class defines a set of static factory methods for constructing
regions. There are properties and methods for accessing basic
information about of a region, such as its bounding box, its size,
whether or not it is convex, whether or not it is empty. There are a
set of methods for supporting algebraic operations on regions, such as
intersection, union, difference, and so on. The set of points in a
region may be iterated over.


<p>Arrays provide indexed access to data at a single Place. An Array may
be either single or multi-dimensional; in X10 the dimensionality of an
Array is recorded in the Array's rank property.  An Array instance of
a particular rank is indexed by using Points of the same rank.  As a
convenience to the programmer, Arrays of rank 4 or less may also be
indexed using the appropriate number of Integer indices. </p>
