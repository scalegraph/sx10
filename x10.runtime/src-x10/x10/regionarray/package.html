<p>Provides an implementation of single place and distributed arrays and
supporting abstractions such as regions, points, and distributions. </p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides an implementation of single place and distributed arrays and
supporting abstractions such as regions, points, and distributions.  The indexing abstractions
supported by this package include flexible and user-extensible regions and distributions. 
Thus the arrays in this package are more flexible than those of the x10.array package, but
also tend to be lower performance. </p>

<h3>Regions, and Arrays</h3>

Region class defines a set of static factory methods for constructing
regions. There are properties and methods for accessing basic
information about of a region, such as its bounding box, its size,
whether or not it is convex, whether or not it is empty. There are a
set of methods for supporting algebraic operations on regions, such as
intersection, union, difference, and so on. The set of points in a
region may be iterated over.


<p>Arrays provide indexed access to data at a single Place. An Array may
be either single or multi-dimensional; in X10 the dimensionality of an
Array is recorded in the Array's rank property.  An Array instance of
a particular rank is indexed by using Points of the same rank.  As a
convenience to the programmer, Arrays of rank 4 or less may also be
indexed using the appropriate number of Integer indices. </p>

<p>DistArrays provide indexed access to data at multiple Places.  The mapping
of Points in the DistArray's Region to Places is specified by the DistArray's
Dist (distribution).  The DistArray class supports user-extensible distributions,
(enabling significant flexibility), but as a result have fairly expensive indexing 
operations.  Computationally intensive code using DistArrays should either use
the simpler DistArray abstractions provided by the x10.array package or make use
of the getLocalPortion() API to access the local backing storage of the DistArray
via the Array class (which supports higher-performance indexing operations).</p>
