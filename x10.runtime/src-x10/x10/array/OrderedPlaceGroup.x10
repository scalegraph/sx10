/**
 * <p>An implementation of PlaceGroup that simply uses a sorted Array[Place] to
 * represent the Places in the group.  This implementation is only suitable
 * when the PlaceGroup contains a fairly small number of places.
 * This can happen either becase the group is very sparse, or because the total 
 * number of places being used by the program is small.  In either case, 
 * this PlaceGroup should have acceptable performance.</p>
 *
 * <p>Although the basic operations (contains, indexOf) could be asymptotically
 * improved from O(N) to O(log(N)) by using binary search instead of linear
 * search, the expected performance of this class would still be poor due to
 * the space overhead of explictly representing all of the Places in the group,
 * which in turn would yield O(size()) serialization costs.  Therefore, we have
 * decided to go with the lower constants and ignore the asymptotic analysis.</p>
