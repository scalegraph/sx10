<p>Provides methods for X10 code to query or modify the behavior of the X10 compiler.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides methods for X10 code to query or modify the behavior 
   of the X10 compiler, including annotations that can be applied to X10 code 
   to instruct the compiler to perform special processing or transformations.  
   Some of the annotations in this package break the usual semantics of X10, 
   so care should be taken to maintain program correctness.</p>
