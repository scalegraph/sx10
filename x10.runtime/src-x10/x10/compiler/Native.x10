/**
 * Annotation to mark methods and fields as having a particular native implementation.
 * lang is the name of the language, typically "java" or "c++".
 * code is the code to insert for a call to the method or an access to the field.
 *
 * <pre>
 * For "java" annotations:
 *
 * Given a method with signature:
 *     def m[X, Y](x, y);
 * and a call
 *     o.m[A, B](a, b);
 * #0 = #this = o
 * #1 = #X = A
 * #2 = #X$box = boxed representation of A
 * #3 = #X$rtt = run-time Type object for A
 * #4 = #Y = B
 * #5 = #Y$box = boxed representation of B
 * #6 = #Y$rtt = run-time Type object for B
 * #7 = #x = a
 * #8 = #y = b
 *
 * For "c++" annotations:
 *
 * As for "java" except boxed and run-time representations of type vars should not be used.
