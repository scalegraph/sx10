 * annotation is to mark a method that only throws 
 * an exception. This information can be exploited by
 * the optimizer to generate more efficient code. 
 * This annotation can effect the semantics of the
 * program, so incorrect usage may result in
 * unexpected results.</p>
 *
 * This annotation is processed by the X10 compiler's
