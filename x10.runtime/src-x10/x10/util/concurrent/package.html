<p>Provides low-level concurrency primitives to supplement the concurrency features available in the X10 language.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides low-level concurrency primitives such as locks,
latches and atomic variables, which may be used in addition to the high-level
concurrency features of the X10 language (async, atomic, when, clocks).
For performance reasons, these classes may be implemented using atomic
machine instructions such as compare-and-swap.</p>
