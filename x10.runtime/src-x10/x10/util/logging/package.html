This package provides a logging interface for X10.

The {@link x10.util.logging.LogFactory} class provides static methods
that can be used to obtain a {@link x10.util.logging.Log} instance,
which can be used for logging.

While the interface is uniform, this package is implemented very
differently for the native (c++) backend and the managed (Java)
backend.  First we describe some <a href="#api">general details about its API</a>, which
are heavily modeled on apache commons-logging.  Then, we describe the
provided implementation for the <a href="#native">native</a> and <a
href="#native">managed</a> backends.

<a name="#api" />
<h1>
General API description
</h1>
The commons usage pattern for the API is to obtain a {@link
package x10.util.logging.Log} instance using one of the static
{@link package x10.util.logging.LogFactory#getLog} methods.

For example, <tt>val LOG = LogFactory.getLog[MyClass]()</tt>.
This instance can then be used for logging at different levels, and
the various <tt>isXXXEnabled</tt> methods can be used to determine if
the given log level will log the message (this should be used to
avoid the expense of message construction for log messages that will
not be logged at the current level).

<a name="#config" />
<h1>
Configuration
</h1>
Configuration is currently very different for the <a
href="#native">native</a> and <a href="#managed">managed</a>
backends.
<p>For the native backend, the logging is not currently very
configurable.  The default log level can be globally configured by setting the
<tt>X10_LOG_LEVEL</tt> environment variable (to a log level string).</p>

<p>For the managed backend, see <a
href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/guide.html#Configuration">the
commons logging documentation</a>.</p>

<a name="#native" />
<h1>
Behavior on the native backend
</h1>
<p>
On the native backend, this package is self-contained.  It contains a
basic implementation of the logging interface, which currently outputs
to standard out.  By default, it logs items at the level of
<tt>INFO</tt> of higher.  This can be globally configured by setting the
<tt>X10_LOG_LEVEL</tt> environment variable to a different log level.
The implementation is currently very
minimal.
</p>

<a name="#managed" />
<h1>
Behavior on the managed backend
</h1>
<p>
On the managed backend, the logging implementation uses <a
href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/">Apache
commons-logging</a>.

In fact, the {@link package x10.util.logging.LogFactory} and {@link
package x10.util.logging.Log} are treated as synonyms for the
equivalent commons logging class.  The system is configured (and
behaves) identically with the commons logging system, so its
documentation should be consulted for more information about the API
as well as configuration.  Apache commons logging is meant as a
bridge over various logging APIs, including <tt>java.util.logging</tt>
and <tt> log4j </tt>.
