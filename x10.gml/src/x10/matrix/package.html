<p>Provides dense matrix and vector classes and the abstract matrix class from which other matrix types are derived. </p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
Operations supported by this library include scaling, addition, subtraction, 
cellwise multiplication, and matrix multiplication.
In order to reuse memory space, matrix operation methods require all inputs 
and output matrix with memory allocated. 
Output matrix also serves as the method invocation instance thereby allowing 
chain operations. 
Only operators allocate memory within their implementations.
</p>

<p>
In most cases, outputs of matrix operations are stored in dense matrix 
or matrix built with dense matrices. 
Only few operations allow using the sparse matrix as output, such as scaling 
operation.
Sparse matrix has confined memory space, and handling more nonzero elements 
than its storage space is complex. 
Therefore, this library generally does not support to use sparse matrix to store
results.
</p>

<p>
One may first develop a sequential program, and then introduce
parallelization in place by merely choosing to distribute the
arrays involved and use finish, async and etc. That is, the
parallel, distributed program looks very similar to the sequential
program. Indeed, the parallelization scheme is much more easily
described in async-finish style rather than in SPMD style.
</p>

<p>
X10's object-oriented features are adequate to describe the nature of the 
specialization scheme. Constrained types can be used to get more static assurances about
the correctness of the code (the compiler is doing more reasoning
on the programmer's behalf).  
</p>

<p>
The program can be easily interfaced with native code,
e.g. for Cholesky factorization, in those cases in which efficient
native libraries are already available.
