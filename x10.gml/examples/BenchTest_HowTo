How to run benchmark test-suite for GNMF, page rank, linear regression and SUMMA.
===============================================================================

This example directory contains several benchmark test-suites, including
1) gnmf     - Gaussian non-negative matrix factorization
2) pagerank - page rank application
3) linreg   - linear regression application
4) summa    - benchmark test for SUMMA algorithm 

All benchmark test-suites share similar testing structure, including test path names, 
test configuration, how tests are launched and executed, and how test output logs 
are parsed.

Please note all benchmark test-suites within this package are created for SLURM system.
Reconfiguration is required to adapt to different cluster environment, which may run different 
resource management systems, such as PBS, LSF, Loadleveler, or NQS. 


------------------------------------
Benchmark test-suite perl scripts
------------------------------------
ptest_config.pl  - configuration scripts for benchmark test-suite.
ptest_size.pl    - scalability test on problem sizes, given fixed number of places.
ptest_core.pl    - scalability test on number of cores (or places), given fixed problem size.


1) Configure benchmark test : ptest_config.pl

Test benchmark settings

* MatrixSizeList - list of matrix dimension (rows or columns of matrix), used in scalability 
                   on problem size. Only one number is need for scalability test on place.  
* NZdensity      - Nonzero density for sparse matrix.
* NodeList       - Numbers of nodes tested for scalability test on places. Only one number needed
                   for scalability test on problem size.
* ProcPerNode    - Process/place on each node. This number should be smaller than number of cores
                   on each node.
* BatchModeOpt   - Options used when launching benchmark test in batch mode. 
* gml_path       - root path of x10.gml
* jopts          - managed backend runtime options. No changes needed.
* itnum          - test iteration number, input of applications.
* LogFile        - Output log file name.
* TestExecList   - Test execution list.
  ** name           -- test executable path name
  ** alloc          -- Resource allocation name. "alloc" is SLURM system's resource allocator. 
  ** wrapper        -- execution wrapper. "srun.mvapich" is wrapper for running native-backend
                       on InfiniBand. "srun.x10sock" is wrapper for running native-backend with 
                       socket communication. "srun.x10java" is wrapper for running managed-backend.
                 
2) Dry-run: listing test-suite execution commands.
./ptest_core.pl 
./ptest_size.pl

3) Launch test-suite
./ptest_core.pl -r
./ptest_size.pl -r

4) Parsing test output logs
./ptest_core.pl -p
./ptest_size.pl -p
