Conversion of applications to support ElemType.

To convert application code to work with either single- or
double-precision matrices/vectors, change all uses of double in
application code to ElemType, if these double's should be float's when
using single-precision.

This can mean that some variables that used to be of type double are
now of type ElemType. In some cases, the right hand side of assignment
statements (whose variables are now of type ElemType) must be
changed. If the RHS e of the assignment statement is still of type
double, it must be changed to be of type ElemType. Usually this is
done by just replacing e with e as ElemType. For instance if c is the
constant 0.0d or 1.0d, change it to be 0.0d as ElemType.
