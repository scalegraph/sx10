/**
 * All nodes that occur in the graph maintained by a constraint
 * must implement Promise. Thus a Promise is a pointer into the state of some specific constraint.
 * <p>
 * A promise contains fields: 
 * <ol>
 * <li>XPromise value  -- if non-null, points to a promise this one has been equated with.
 * <li>Collection<XPromise> disequals -- contains set of other nodes this has been disequated with
 * <li>XTerm var  -- externally visible term labeling this promise
 * <li>Map<XName, XPromise> fields -- hashmap of fields of this promise (if any). 
 * </ol>
 * It maintains the invariant <code>> value != null</code> implies <code>disequals==null && fields == null</code>.
 * That is, if <code>value !=null</code> (in this case we say the promise ie <em>bound</em>), all further
 * information about this node in the graph is found by going to to <code>value</code>, except for the <code>XTerm</code>  
 * labeling this node (<code>var</code>). See <code>term()</code>.
 * 
 * <p>If <code>a.value==b</code>
 * we sometimes say that <code>b</code> has an incoming "eq" link, and <code>a</code> has an outgoing "eq" link.
 * 
 * <p> Constraint graphs may contain sequences of such bindings. These can be shortened without any
 * semantic consequence.
 * 
 * <p> Constraint graphs are always acyclic. 
 * 
 * <p> Note: This interface is not public only so that extensions of this constraint system may use it.
 * This interface is <em>not</em> intended to be used by customers of the constraint system.
