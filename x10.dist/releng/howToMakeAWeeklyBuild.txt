Notes on how to make an X10/X10DT Weekly Build

Making a weekly build is a subset of the steps to make a full-blown release.
   1. "Tag" the weekly build by using x10.dist/releng/makeTag.sh 
      Use a "good" svn revision number that matches one reported by a 
      night-sanity run. i.e.

      makeTag -rev 12500 -tag WB_20130620 -x10 -x10dt

   2. Go to Jenkins, select the Package-X10-Release job and then select
      "Build With Parameters".  Select the appropriate svn tag, fill in
      the version number, and other parameters then hit the 'Build' button.
      Note, depending on how loaded slave machines are this step may take
      several hours to complete.  Tarballs will be automatically published
      on orquesta as they are available.

   3. In the RTC build engine, edit the definitions for the X10DT and 
      X10DT Editor Only Weekly Builds to use the tag/version you created
      in steps 1 and 2.

   4. Request builds of X10DT/X10DT Editor Edition
