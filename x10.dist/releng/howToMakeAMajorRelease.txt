Notes on how to make an X10 Release.

A number of artifacts are produced as part of making an X10 release.
The main artifacts are:

   1. A source release of X10.
   2. A source release of the X10 test suite.
   3. A source release of the X10 benchmarks.
   4. Binary platform-dependent releases that contain both the Java 
      and C++ backend and runtimes for each supported OS/hardware target.
   5. PDF of the X10 language specification

The following is the procedure used to make a release of X10 and X10DT.

I. Just before creating the release branch of X10 and X10DT

   1. Update the version information in x10.compiler/src/x10/Version.java

   2. Update the plugin manifest version in all MANIFEST.MF files in 
      X10 core projects. Also update product files and common.properties.
      (do recursive find/grep to find previous verison number and 
       change it)

II. Create the release branch and enter into final testing phase

   1. Create a branch by using x10.dist/releng/makeBranch.sh 
      Use a svn revision number that matches one reported by a 
      night-sanity run. i.e.

      makeBranch.sh -rev 27050 -branch x10-2.4.1 -x10

   2. Branch the internal test suite svn as well using svn copy.

   3. Clone the appropriate Build and Test jobs in Jenkins 
      to enable testing on the branch you just created.

   4. If fixes need to be applied to the release after it is created, apply 
      fixes to trunk first. After they pass regression testing on trunk, 
      pull them over to the release branch using

        svn merge -c <change revision> ^/trunk

III. When all necessary fixes have been propagated to the release branch,
     one can tag the release in svn and build the actual release artifacts:

   1. Update JIRA version management to indicate that version has been released.

   2. Edit and commit release notes to the trunk. Release notes can be
      mostly generated from JIRA.  Use svn merge to get the release
      notes from the trunk to the release branch.

   3. Tag the release by using x10.dist/releng/makeTag.sh 
      Use a svn revision number that matches one reported by a 
      testing run. i.e.

      makeTag.sh -rev 28000 -branch x10-2.4.1 -tag SF_RELEASE_2_4_1_2 -x10

   4. Go to Jenkins, select the Package-X10-Release job and then select
      "Build With Parameters".  Select the appropriate svn tag, fill in
      the version number, and other parameters then hit the 'Build' button.
      Note, depending on how loaded slave machines are this step may take
      several hours to complete.  Tarballs will be automatically published
      on orquesta as they are available.

   5. ssh into shell.sf.net and create a subdirectory of 
      /home/frs/project/x/x1/x10 to hold the downloads. 
      Use sftp to move all of the release artifacts from orquesta to sf.
      Rename RELEASE_NOTES.txt to README.txt in the sf download area
      Use SF web admin API to set the default downloads for each OS 
      platform to the new files

   6. ssh into shell.sf.net and create a subdirectory of 
      /home/frs/project/x/x1/x10dt to hold the downloads. 
      Use sftp to move all of the release artifacts from orquesta to sf.

   7. ssh into shell.sf.net and create a subdirectory of 
      /home/project-web/x10/htdocs/x10dt to hold the x10dt update site.
      create an updateSite subdir of the new directory and unzip the
      update site zip from the download section into it.
      Also create an updateSite-EditorOnly subdir and unzip 
      the X10DT Editor Only Edition update site into it.

   8. Make sure language manual has the right version, date, etc. 
      Tag the language manual

        makeTag -rev 12500 -tag SF_RELEASE_2_0_1 -man

      Put language spec pdf in project web space at x10.sourceforge.net
      Update in place x10-latest.pdf in addition to creating a 
      x10-<version>.pdf. 
      The release page itself will point to the x10-<version>.pdf. 
      All of the other parts of the website refer to x10-latest.pdf.

   9. Generate new x10doc and upload to project web space at x10.sourceforge.net
      update the "latest" sym link to point to the new directory.

   10. Create a release page for the new release on the web site.  
      Update the "X10 Releases" page to link to the new download version.
      Update the "latest release" menu item in Downloads-submenu to point to 
      the new release page.
      Create a redirect entry to get a nice external URL 
         (eg  http://x10-lang.org/releases/x10-release-223) for the release.

   11. Post release announcement in SF news and web page front-page news.

   12. Send out mail announcements to x10-users and x10-announce
