Notes on how to make a minor X10/X10DT Release

The steps are the same for making minor releases based off a branch
(eg making x10 2.4.1.4 from the x10 2.4.1 branch) or for making a
weekly build off the trunk. The only difference is the naming scheme
used for the tags and the portion of the repository that is tagged.

For an X10 only release there are only two steps:

   1. "Tag" the release by using x10.dist/releng/makeTag.sh
       Before tagging verify by inspecting Jenkins test results 
       that you are tagging a "good" svn version.

       To tag basing off a branch do:
         makeTag.sh -rev 27400 -branch x10-2.4.2 -tag 2.4.2.1 -x10

       To tag basing off the trunk do
         makeTag.sh -rev 27400 -branch trunk -tag WB_20140212 -x10

   2. Go to Jenkins, select the Package-X10-Release job and then select
      "Build With Parameters".  Select the appropriate svn tag, fill in
      the version number, and other parameters then hit the 'Build' button.
      Note, depending on how loaded slave machines are this step may take
      several hours to complete.  Tarballs will be automatically published
      on orquesta as they are available.

To also build an X10DT that will incorporate the X10 minor release
you just made, there are two or three additional steps:

   1. Optionally use makeTag to tag x10dt as well
         makeTag.sh -rev 27400 -branch trunk -tag WB_20140212 -x10dt

   2. In the RTC build engine, edit the definitions for the X10DT and 
      X10DT Editor Only Weekly Builds to use the 
      tag/version you created via makeTag.

   3. Request builds of X10DT/X10DT Editor Edition
