Notes on how to maintain content on the http://x10-lang.org website.

The primary content of the website is maintained in the Joomla content
management system.  Editing the content is done via administrative interface
at http://x10plus.cloudaccess.net/administrator/.  If you need to make
changes to pages in Joomla, you will need an account at this site and
some basic training on how we have structured the website and the care
and feeding of the various aspects of it.  Talk to Dave Grove, Ben
Herta, Mike Hind, or John Thomas for more information.

Secondary content is now served from the project website area
of the X10 sourceforge project.  Sourceforge has fairly decent
documentation on how to maintain web content at 
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Project%20web
Some specifics on SF.
  (a) static content lives on the server at /home/project-web/x10/htdocs
  (b) using rsync or ssh/sftp/scp to push files to the webserver file
      system is the easiest way to maintain it. For example:
        rsync -av <stuff> <SF-ID>,x10@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/<PATH_TO_STUFF>
  (c) The file /home/project-web/x10/htdocs/foo/bar will be accessible
      at the URL http://x10.sourceforge.net/foo/bar
  (d) The top level URL (http://x10.sourceforge.net) redirects to
    http://x10-lang.org because http://x10.sourceforge.net/index.php 
    redirects it, but "child" URLs will go through without being
    redirected. 

Historically, we generated the x10-lang.org web page from the
confluence wiki (http://docs.codehaus.org/display/XTENLANG/Home) and
served static content from http://dist.codehaus.org/x10. The codehaus
part of our web presence is no longer current and no new content
should be added there.  The wiki portion of the website has been
mostly removed to avoid search engines finding old content.  The files
on dist.codehaus.org/x10 are still in place, because significant
portions of them are needed by the build procedures for prior releases
of X10. 

In general, talk to Dave Grove if you have any questions on the
current structure of the website or how to best maintain it.
