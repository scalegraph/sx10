An work-in-progress example of using Java interoperability to run very small Hadoop computation (WordCount).

Building
========

Assuming you already have built the X10 workspace, run the following:

    ant prepare		# to download Hadoop jars
    make		# to compile 

Running (not tested yet, as post-compilation fails)
=======

    make run		# to run
