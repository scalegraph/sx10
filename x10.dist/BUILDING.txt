This is a source distribution of the 
X10 Programming Language (http://x10-lang.org/).

Detailed instructions for building X10 from source can be found online
at http://x10-lang.org/x10-development/building-x10-from-source.html.

In a nutshell, building X10 is driven by ant.  

If you have the prerequisites installed on your machine 
(see the online documentation for details), then building X10 
from source can be done with a single ant command:

  cd x10.dist && ant -Doptimize=true dist
