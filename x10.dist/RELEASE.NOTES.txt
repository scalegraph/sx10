X10 Release 2.5.4

HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS RELEASE

The main features of this release are improvements in Resilient X10.
  (a) Significant performance improvements to the implementations of
      resilient finish to eliminate resiliency overheads of local
      activity creation. 
  (b) The addition of ULFM-MPI as a network transport for Resilient
      X10 applications.
  (c) Enhanced standard library support for writing Resilient X10
      applications and frameworks (see x10.util.resilient).

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The size and index of arrays must be less than 2^31 with Managed X10.
An attempt to allocate a longer array causes IllegalArgumentException. 

The following features described in the 2.5 language manual do not
currently work and may be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with Native X10.
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.4.
  + On Power/Linux and BG/Q, you may either use g++ 4.2 or better
    or xlC 11.1 or better.
