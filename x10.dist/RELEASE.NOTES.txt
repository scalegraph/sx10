Release 2.3.1

MAJOR CHANGES

No major changes were made in the X10 language
specification and implementation in this release.

Please consult the language specification for the details of
any minor language changes and specification clarifications made in
this release.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The following features described in the 2.3 language manual do not
currently work and may be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with Native X10.
  - Garbage collection on AIX
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

Although greatly improved from previous releases, the X10 runtime 
still uses a modified "busy wait" loop in the worker threads that 
execute asyncs. A consequence of this is that even if a Place has 
no asyncs to execute, one worker thread in the Place will still consume
CPU cycles busy waiting for messages to arrive from the network.  

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.4.
  + On AIX and Power/Linux, you may either use g++ 4.2 or better or 
    xlC 10.1.0.4 or better. 
  + Some versions of Xcode on MacOS default to using the Clang C++
    front-end; Clang cannot compile the generated C++ code; you need to
    use the g++ front-end.  To do this export CC=gcc; CXX=g++.
