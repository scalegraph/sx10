LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The following features described in the 2.2.0 language manual do not
currently work and will be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:
  - Garbage collection on AIX
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

As in previous releases, the X10 runtime uses a "busy wait" loop
in the worker threads that execute asyncs. A consequence of this is
that even if a place has no asyncs to execute, it will still consume
CPU cycles busy waiting for new asyncs to be created.  
See XTENLANG-1012 for more details.

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.3.2.  On AIX, you
may either use g++ 4.2 or better or xlC 10.1.0.4 or better.
