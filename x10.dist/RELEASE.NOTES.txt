Release 2.1.0

This release includes both the C++ and Java backends and runtimes.

Items to highlight for 2.1.1 release:
  (a) change in rail for Array/Region to be a standalone property 
     -- supports more effective optimization, but code that used to say
        Array[T]{rail} in 2.1.0 now needs to say Array[T](1){rail} because
        rail no longer implies rank==1 in a way that is understood by the 
        constraint system.

Please consult the language specification for the details of
these changes and for a list of additional changes.

The following features described in the 2.1.0 language manual do not
currently work and will be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)
  - Type definitions as package members (i.e., in the outermost scope of
    a compilation unit)

There is one known limitation of the 2.1.0 release that represents
a regression with respect to 2.0.6.
  - String concatenation via the '+' operator is asymmetric. 
    If the first argument to '+' is not a String, it will be necessary
    to explicitly add a ""+ first.  For example:
        val x = 3;
        val s = x + " hi ";
    would need to be written
        val x = 3;
        val s = ""+ x + " hi ";
    or 
        val x = 3;
        val s = x.toString() + " hi ";

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:
  - Garbage collection on AIX and BG/P
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin
  - Finally blocks and atomic sections that exit via non-exceptional
    control flow before the end of the block (eg with return, break, 
    or continue statements).

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.3.2.  On AIX, you
may either use g++ 4.2 or better or xlC 10.01.0000.0004 or better.
