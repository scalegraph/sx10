X10 Release 2.4.1

HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS RELEASE

There were no significant language changes or class library API
changes made in this release of X10. 

Several major new capabilities are available for the first time in X10 2.4.1
  (1) A technology preview of Resilient X10 is including in this
      release. Resilient X10 (described in an upcoming PPoPP'14 paper;
      a preprint is available from x10-lang.org) adds the ability for
      X10 programs to continue execution even if one or more places
      fail.  For details on how to use Resilient X10, please see the
      notes and example programs in samples/resiliency.
  (2) Managed X10 on Windows now supports multi-place (multi-JVM)
      execution using a new pure-Java implementation of X10RT
      (JavaSockets).  With this release, there is still a cygwin
      dependency for launching Managed X10 on windows.  
  (3) Our pre-built distributions of X10 and X10DT for Windows is now
      based on Windows 7 instead of Windows XP.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The size and index of arrays must be less than 2^31 with Managed X10.
An attempt to allocate a longer array causes IllegalArgumentException. 

The following features described in the 2.4 language manual do not
currently work and may be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with Native X10.
  - Garbage collection on AIX
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

Although greatly improved from previous releases, the X10 runtime 
still uses a modified "busy wait" loop in the worker threads that 
execute asyncs. A consequence of this is that even if a Place has 
no asyncs to execute, one worker thread in the Place will still consume
CPU cycles busy waiting for messages to arrive from the network.  

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.4.
  + On AIX and Power/Linux, you may either use g++ 4.2 or better or 
    xlC 11.1 or better.
