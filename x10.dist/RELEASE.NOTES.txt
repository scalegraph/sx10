X10 Release 2.4.2

HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS RELEASE

There were no significant language changes or 
incompatible class library API changes made in 
this release of X10. 

An implementation of the X10 GlobalLoadBalancing framework (GLB)
has been incorporated into the x10 standard library in the
x10.glb package. Additional sample X10 programs using GLB 
are available in samples/GLB.

We have completed the work on a (single host) pure Java launcher
for Managed X10.  This allows multi-place execution on Managed X10
on a single Windows host without requiring cygwin.  This capability
is available from X10DT when launching a Managed X10 application on
a local Windows host.

Support for the closed source x10rt_pgas implementation and
the BlueGene/P platform was removed from X10 starting with 
this release.

Several bugs in the CUDA backend present in X10 2.4.0 and 2.4.1
were corrected in this release.  All CUDA sample programs 
now compile and run successfully using the latest (v5.5) release
of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The size and index of arrays must be less than 2^31 with Managed X10.
An attempt to allocate a longer array causes IllegalArgumentException. 

The following features described in the 2.4 language manual do not
currently work and may be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with Native X10.
  - Garbage collection on AIX
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

Although greatly improved from previous releases, the X10 runtime 
still uses a modified "busy wait" loop in the worker threads that 
execute asyncs. A consequence of this is that even if a Place has 
no asyncs to execute, one worker thread in the Place will still consume
CPU cycles busy waiting for messages to arrive from the network.  

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.4.
  + On AIX and Power/Linux, you may either use g++ 4.2 or better or 
    xlC 11.1 or better.
