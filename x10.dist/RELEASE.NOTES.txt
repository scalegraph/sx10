Release 2.3.0

MAJOR CHANGES

The following major changes were made in the X10 language
specification and implementation in this release.

  + Java interoperability summary (Mikio to write).

  + The semantics of static field initialization were changed so
    that static fields are now lazily initialized on a per-Place basis 
    when the field is first read by an activity executing in a given Place.
    For more details, please see Section 8.6 (Static Initialization) in
    the language specification. 

  + Improvements in XRX busy-wait loop (Olivier to write)



Please consult the language specification for the details of
any minor language changes and specification clarifications made in
this release.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The following features described in the 2.3.0 language manual do not
currently work and will be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:
  - Garbage collection on AIX
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

Although greatly improved from previous releases, the X10 runtime 
still uses a modified "busy wait" loop in the worker threads that 
execute asyncs. A consequence of this is that even if a Place has 
no asyncs to execute, one worker thread in the Place will still consume
CPU cycles busy waiting for messages to arrive from the network.  

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.3.2.  On AIX, you
may either use g++ 4.2 or better or xlC 10.1.0.4 or better.
