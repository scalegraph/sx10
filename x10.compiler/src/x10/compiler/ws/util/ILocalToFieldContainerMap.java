/**
 * Originally, all locals are just locals
 * After WS transformation, locals are transformed as fields in different levels' fields
 * So all local access should be transformed as field acess
 *   e.g. n = 10 ==> _fib.n = 10
 * However, the field container's ref "_fib" should be provided by the WS code gen, too.
 * So here we provide this interface to do this transformation.
