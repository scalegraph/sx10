/**
 * @author Haichuan
 * 
 * In a ws code transformation, each code path will be transformed into fast and 
 * slow path.
 * 
 * But for a closure, originally it has one declare and one def.
 * But after transformation, it will have two declares with still only one def,
 *  which causes error for further transformation.
 *  
 * This code visitor will create a new closure def for all closure in the AST tree.
 * 
 * It should be added as one job in synthesizing the slow path
