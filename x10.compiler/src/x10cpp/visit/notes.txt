Notes for Krishna

-- Need class javadoc.
-- What is a "ClassifiedStream"? Cant igure out why it is "Classified".
-- Use @Override where applicable.
-- Why super.write in write?
-- Separate out abstractions. ClassifiedStream appears to be an IndentedStringOutputStream + 
   application-dependent state (cc,h, inc}.
-- Why define close()?
-- Is there an assumption that a WritersStream has only one output file for each StreamClassExtension?
   (this is an application-dependent constraint)


Notes in discussion w/ Igor

arraysAsRefs and friends -- some of these parameters are not needed/will 
not work if you change the value from what it currently is. So these should
not really be parameters. 

Iniling methods --- if there is a parameter, inline it.

Call_c is huge.

LocalDecl_c is huge.
