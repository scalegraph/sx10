This directory contains outer level of scripts and a sample crontab
entry for running the X10 regression tests and reporting the results
in the cattrack application.

In addition to the files here to enable a new regression machine at watson
you will also need the contents of the .ssh directory from an existing 
machine (configuration and private keys for access to the cattrack server).
