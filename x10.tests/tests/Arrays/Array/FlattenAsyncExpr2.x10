/**
 * Java and X10 permit a call to a method which returns a value to occur as a statement.
 * The returned value is discarded. However, Java does not permit a variable standing alone
 * as a statement. Thus the x10 compiler must check that as a result of flattening it does
 * not produce a variable standing alone. 
 * In an earlier implementation this would give a t0 not reachable error.
