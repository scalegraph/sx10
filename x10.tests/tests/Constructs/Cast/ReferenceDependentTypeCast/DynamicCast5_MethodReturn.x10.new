/**
 * Purpose: Checks an object returned by a method is correctly 
 * checked against target type constraints.
 * Issue: The objectReturner method should only invoked once by the dynamic cast checking code.
 *        Otherwise if the method has side effects program's behavior may be modified.
 * Note: The following code will use java reflexion to dynamically checks constraints.
