/**
 * A test case that illustrates that deadlock is possible
 * with futures, by creating a circular wait-for dependency.
 *
 * A0 spawns future activities A1 and A2 and saves the "future"
 * handles from A1 and A2 in global future variables f1 and f2,
 * respectively.
 *
 * A1 sleeps a sufficient time to ensure A0 is done setting f2, then
 * reads global variable f2 and waits for the corresponding activity
 * (A2) to finish.
 *
 * A2 also sleeps a sufficient time to ensure A0 is done setting f1,
 * and then reads global variable f1 and waits for the corresponding
 * activity (A1) to finish.
 *
 * In the meantime A0 starts waiting for A1 to finish.
 *
 * Expected result: must deadlock.
 *
 * NB: This test case uses a sleep timer to
 * choreograph events on second granularily.
