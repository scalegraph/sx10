/**
 * Basic rail performance test. Allocate a rail, assign values to each
 * element, read it back.
 *
 * Test is written to simulate treating the rail as a 2-d array in
 * order to facilitate comparisons with array performance tests
 * SeqPseudoArray2*.* and SeqArray2*.*.
 *
 * The following tests all do essentially the same work and so ideally
 * should deliver the same performance: SeqRail2.*,
 * SeqPseudoArray2*.*, SeqArray2*.*.
