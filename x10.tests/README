This is the test suite for the X10 Programming Language.

The active set of test cases can be found in the tests directory tree.

The script bin/runTest.sh is used to compile & execute sets of test cases
and optionally record the results in XML files using the JUnit schema.
For details, on command line arguments to runTests.sh, do
  bin/runTest.sh -help

For example, to run all the test cases in tests/Samples with Native X10 do

cd tests
../bin/runTest.sh -native -l Samples

You might need to make the scripts in bin executable before running them.
