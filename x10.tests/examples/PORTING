This directory is seeded with tests cases ported from X10 1.5.

- Files named X.x10 have already been ported and pass visual inspection.  They might not actually parse or type-check yet.
- Files named X.x10.old are the original X10 1.5 files. 
- Files named X.x10.new are the output of running the 1.5 test cases through an automatic rewriter with some scripted massaging of the output.  These files are unlikely to compile.  The typical problems with these files are:
  - Duplicated code.  Go to the bottom of the file and look for code that got copied more than once.
  - nullable<T> should become Box[T] or just T if a reference type.
  - new T[] { ... } should become just [ ... ].
  - Array[T] should often be Rail[T], but be careful.
  - 'future<T> (p) { e }' should be 'future[T] (p) e'.
  - '(T) x' should be 'x to T'.
  - 'T x1, y1' to rewritten as 'var x1: Tvar x2: T'.  Look for things like '[^ \t\(]var'.
  - 'final val' should be 'val'

After visually inspecting the X.x10.new file, rename it to X.x10, removing X.x10.new.  Please keep X.x10.old for reference until the test case passes.
