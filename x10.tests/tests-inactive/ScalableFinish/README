This folder contains examples of finish-async patterns we optimize.
Each program contains two "finish"-es: the first one is not annotated, and
used only for timing. The second one is annotated with the correct pattern.

If the compiler finds a different pattern from the programmer specifies,
it will produce an warning, and the programmer's choice is respected. 

LocalFinish, ManyLocalFinish1, and ManyLocalFinish2 have the pattern that 
all "async"s in a "finish" are in the same place as the "finish".

SimpleFinish* have the pattern that remote "async"s only spawn local 
"async"s.
